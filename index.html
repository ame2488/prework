    <main class="container">
        <p>The upsetting part of my chemical romance is that they split up. I wish they were making music together. They were my saviors. They were the band i listen to them through 6th grade - Present. The reason why i started listening to them in 6th grade is because thats when i knew what "Amazing, terrific" music was. 
            To be honest with you if i had a favorite in this band in a list it would be</p>
            <ul>
                <li>         Frank Iero</li>
                <li>Gerard way</li>
                <li> Bob Bryar</li>
                <li>Mikey way</li>
                <li>Ray Toro</li>
            </ul>

            Yes i know its not right to have favorites but i really don't but that would probably be the list form.
            But Frank Iero is my screensaver on my phone. Well lock-screen to be exact.
            But my screen for my computer is The band. Yes! Gerard,Ray,Bob,Mikey,and Frank. all on one screen. Ahh 0.0

           <p> Well, if you wanted honesty
That's all you had to say
I never want to let you down
Or have you go, it's better off this way
For all the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
Remember when you broke your foot
From jumping out the second floor?</p>
<p>I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay</p>
<p>You wear me out
What will it take to show you
That it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay)
I've told you time and time again
You sing the words but don't know what it means (I'm not okay)
To be a joke and look
Another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook
For the last time, take a good hard look
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out
Forget about the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
You said you read me like a book
But the pages all are torn and frayed
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay now (I'm okay, now)
But you really need to listen to me
Because I'm telling you the truth
I mean this, I'm okay! (Trust me)
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
Well, I'm not okay, I'm not o-fucking-kay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay</p>
